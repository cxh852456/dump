Frontend for SysInternals PsTools version 2
===========================================

Frontend for PsTools (FePsTools) is a graphical interface around the
command line tools from SysInternal's PsTools.

FePsTools gives you an easy way to build the command you need to execute a
PsTool utility.

While you are clicking and typing the needed options you can see the
command line build up.

Once you have created the command line FePsTool can execute the command for
you and will show you the results.
It can also create a shortcut from your command line or you can copy the
command line and use it in your script.

Just as the PsTool, you may use FePsTools freely, as long as you don't sell it.

Installation and Usage
======================
To use FePsTool you will also need to download the command line PsTools from
the SysInternals website.

There is no special installation required. Just copy the FePsTools executable
in any directory and run it. It would be a good idea to install the exe in the
same directory where you keep the PsTools utilities.

FePsTools is written for .NET Framework 2.0 and higher, so if the .NET Framework is not allready installed
on you computer you should also download and install it first.

On first usage you must enter the directory where the SysInternals PsTools are
installed. Choose settings from the main menu and fill in the directory.
