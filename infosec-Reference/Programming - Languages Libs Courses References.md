| **Graudit** - Graudit is a simple script and signature sets that allows you to find potential security flaws in source code using the GNU utility grep. It's comparable to other static analysis applications like RATS, SWAAT and flaw-finder while keeping the technical requirements to a minimum and being very flexible. | http://www.justanotherhacker.com/projects/graudit.html

Impacket https://github.com/CoreSecurity/impacket
Impacket is a collection of Python classes for working with network protocols. Impacket is focused on providing low-level programmatic access to the packets and for some protocols (for instance NMB, SMB1-3 and MS-DCERPC) the protocol implementation itself. Packets can be constructed from scratch, as well as parsed from raw data, and the object oriented API makes it simple to work with deep hierarchies of protocols. The library provides a set of tools as examples of what can be done within the context of this library.
rr is a lightweight tool for recording and replaying execution of applications (trees of processes and threads). More information about the project, including instructions on how to install, run, and build rr, is at http://rr-project.org.

[PHPMD - PHP Mess Detector](http://phpmd.org/about.html)  * What PHPMD does is: It takes a given PHP source code base and look for several potential problems within that source. These problems can be things like: Possible bugs; Suboptimal code; Overcomplicated expressions; Unused parameters, methods, properties.

[PMD](http://pmd.sourceforge.net/)
* PMD is a source code analyzer. It finds common programming flaws like unused variables, empty catch blocks, unnecessary object creation, and so forth. It supports Java, JavaScript, PLSQL, Apache Velocity, XML, XSL. 
Additionally it includes CPD, the copy-paste-detector. CPD finds duplicated code in Java, C, C++, C#, PHP, Ruby, Fortran, JavaScript, PLSQL, Apache Velocity, Ruby, Scala, Objective C, Matlab, Python, Go.

###<a name="sca">Source Code Analysis</a>


[RIPS]http://rips-scanner.sourceforge.net/)
* RIPS is a tool written in PHP to find vulnerabilities in PHP applications using static code analysis. By tokenizing and parsing all source code files RIPS is able to transform PHP source code into a program model and to detect sensitive sinks (potentially vulnerable functions) that can be tainted by user input (influenced by a malicious user) during the program flow. Besides the structured output of found vulnerabilities RIPS also offers an integrated code audit framework for further manual analysis.

###<a name="c">C/C++</a>

[Stanford C 101](http://cslibrary.stanford.edu/101/EssentialC.pdf)
* Stanford CS Education Library: A 45 page summary of the C language. Explains all the common features and techniques for the C language. The coverage is pretty quick, so it is most appropriate for someone with some programming background who needs to see how C works. Topics include variables, int types, floating point types, promotion, truncation, operators, control structures (if, while, for), functions, value parameters, reference parameters, structs, pointers, arrays, the pre-processor, and the standard C library functions. (revised 4/2003)

[Stanford C Pointers and Memory](http://cslibrary.stanford.edu/102/PointersAndMemory.pdf)
* Stanford CS Education Library: a 31 page introduction to programming with pointers and memory in C, C++ and other languages. Explains how pointers and memory work and how to use them -- from the basic concepts through all the major programming techniques. Can be used as an introduction to pointers for someone with basic programming experience or as a quick review. Many advanced programming and debugging problems only make sense with a solid understanding of pointers and memory -- this document tries to provide that understanding.

####Learn
[Learn Python the Hard Way](http://learnpythonthehardway.org/book/)



[Python For Beginners]( Python For Beginners
* Welcome! Are you completely new to programming? If not then we presume you will be looking for information about why and how to get started with Python. Fortunately an experienced programmer in any programming language (whatever it may be) can pick up Python very quickly. It's also easy for beginners to use and learn, so jump in!

####Libraries

[Python Library for interacting with Serial Ports](http://pyserial.sourceforge.net/)

[Hachoir](https://bitbucket.org/haypo/hachoir/wiki/Home)
* Hachoir is a Python library that allows to view and edit a binary stream field by field

[Equip: python bytecode instrumentation](https://github.com/neuroo/equip)
* equip is a small library that helps with Python bytecode instrumentation. Its API is designed to be small and flexible to enable a wide range of possible instrumentations. The instrumentation is designed around the injection of bytecode inside the bytecode of the program to be instrumented. However, the developer does not need to know anything about the Python bytecode since the injected code is Python source.

[Construct2](https://github.com/construct/construct)
* Construct is a powerful declarative parser (and builder) for binary data.  Instead of writing imperative code to parse a piece of data, you declaratively define a data structure that describes your data. As this data structure is not code, you can use it in one direction to parse data into Pythonic objects, and in the other direction, convert ("build") objects into binary data.

###Useful Libraries/programs

[Shellpaste](https://github.com/andrew-morris/shellpaste)
* Tiny snippet of code that pulls ASCII shellcode from pastebin and executes it. The purpose of this is to have a minimal amount of benign code so AV doesn't freak out, then it pulls down the evil stuff. People have been doing this kind of stuff for years so I take no credit for the concept. That being said, this code (or similar code) works surprisingly often during pentests when conventional malware fails.
