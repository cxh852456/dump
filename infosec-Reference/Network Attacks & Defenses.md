###<a name="tools">Tools</a>

[psexec](https://github.com/pentestgeek/smbexec)
* A rapid psexec style attack with samba tools
* [Blogpost that inspired it](http://carnal0wnage.attackresearch.com/2012/01/psexec-fail-upload-and-exec-instead.html)

[Sparty - MS Sharepoint and Frontpage Auditing Tool](http://sparty.secniche.org/)
*  Sparty is an open source tool written in python to audit web applications using sharepoint and frontpage architecture. The motivation behind this tool is to provide an easy and robust way to scrutinize the security configurations of sharepoint and frontpage based web applications. Due to the complex nature of these web administration software, it is required to have a simple and efficient tool that gathers information, check access permissions, dump critical information from default files and perform automated exploitation if security risks are identified. A number of automated scanners fall short of this and Sparty is a solution to that. 

[w3af](https://github.com/andresriancho/w3af)
* w3af: web application attack and audit framework, the open source web vulnerability scanner.

[Yersinia](http://www.yersinia.net/)

* Responder is a LLMNR, NBT-NS and MDNS poisoner, with built-in HTTP/SMB/MSSQL/FTP/LDAP rogue authentication server supporting NTLMv1/NTLMv2/LMv2, Extended Security NTLMSSP and Basic HTTP authentication.

[NbtScan](http://www.unixwiz.net/tools/nbtscan.html)
* This is a command-line tool that scans for open NETBIOS nameservers on a local or remote TCP/IP network, and this is a first step in finding of open shares. It is based on the functionality of the standard Windows tool nbtstat, but it operates on a range of addresses instead of just one. I wrote this tool because the existing tools either didn't do what I wanted or ran only on the Windows platforms: mine runs on just about everything. 

[netcat](http://nc110.sourceforge.net/)
* Network Swiss army knife. Ncat’s predecessor. Does everything and the kitchen sink.

[Ncat](http://nmap.org/)
* Ncat is a feature-packed networking utility which reads and writes data across networks from the command line. Ncat was written for the Nmap Project as a much-improved reimplementation of the venerable Netcat. It uses both TCP and UDP for communication and is designed to be a reliable back-end tool to instantly provide network connectivity to other applications and users. Ncat will not only work with IPv4 and IPv6 but provides the user with a virtually limitless number of potential uses. 

[Nmap](http://nmap.org/)
* Nmap ("Network Mapper") is a free and open source (license) utility for network discovery and security auditing. Many systems and network administrators also find it useful for tasks such as network inventory, managing service upgrade schedules, and monitoring host or service uptime. Nmap uses raw IP packets in novel ways to determine what hosts are available on the network, what services (application name and version) those hosts are offering, what operating systems (and OS versions) they are running, what type of packet filters/firewalls are in use, and dozens of other characteristics. It was designed to rapidly scan large networks, but works fine against single hosts. Nmap runs on all major computer operating systems, and official binary packages are available for Linux, Windows, and Mac OS X. In addition to the classic command-line Nmap executable, the Nmap suite includes an advanced GUI and results viewer (Zenmap), a flexible data transfer, redirection, and debugging tool (Ncat), a utility for comparing scan results (Ndiff), and a packet generation and response analysis tool (Nping). 

[Angry IP Scanner](http://angryip.org/
* Angry IP Scanner (or simply ipscan) is an open-source and cross-platform network scanner designed to be fast and simple to use. It scans IP addresses and ports as well as has many other features. 

[UnicornScan](http://www.unicornscan.org/)

It was designed to provide an engine that is Scalable, Accurate, Flexible, and Efficient. It is released for the community to use under the terms of the GPL license. 
* My note: Use this to mass scan networks. It’s faster than nmap at scanning large host lists and allows you to see live hosts quickly.

[DNSEnum](https://github.com/fwaeytens/dnsenum)
* Multithreaded perl script to enumerate DNS information of a domain and to discover non-contiguous ip blocks.

[Enum4Linux](https://labs.portcullis.co.uk/tools/enum4linux/)
* Enum4linux is a tool for enumerating information from Windows and Samba systems. It attempts to offer similar functionality to enum.exe formerly available from www.bindview.com. It is written in Perl and is basically a wrapper around the Samba tools smbclient, rpclient, net and nmblookup. The tool usage can be found below followed by examples, previous versions of the tool can be found at the bottom of the page.

[Onesixtyone](http://www.phreedom.org/software/onesixtyone/)
* onesixtyone is an SNMP scanner which utilizes a sweep technique to achieve very high performance. It can scan an entire class B network in under 13 minutes. It can be used to discover devices responding to well-known community names or to mount a dictionary attack against one or more SNMP devices.

[Hping](http://www.hping.org/)
*While hping was mainly used as a security tool in the past, it can be used in many ways by people that don't care about security to test networks and hosts. A subset of the stuff you can do using hping: Firewall testing; Advanced port scanning; Network testing, using different protocols, TOS, fragmentation; Manual path MTU discovery etc.

[TXTDNS](http://www.txdns.net/)
* TXDNS is a Win32 aggressive multithreaded DNS digger. Capable of placing, on the wire, thousands of DNS queries per minute. TXDNS main goal is to expose a domain namespace trough a number of techniques: Typos: Mised, doouble and transposde keystrokes; TLD/ccSLD rotation; Dictionary attack; Full Brute-force attack using alpha, numeric or alphanumeric charsets; Reverse grinding.

[JXplorer](http://jxplorer.org/)
* JXplorer is a cross platform LDAP browser and editor. It is a standards compliant general purpose LDAP client that can be used to search, read and edit any standard LDAP directory, or any directory service with an LDAP or DSML interface. It is highly flexible and can be extended and customised in a number of ways. JXplorer is written in java, and the source code and Ant build system are available via svn or as a packaged build for users who want to experiment or further develop the program. 	

[LDAPMfINER](http://ldapminer.sourceforge.net/)
* This is a tool I wrote to collect information from different LDAP Server implementation. This was written in C with the Netscape C 


[Firewalk](http://packetfactory.openwall.net/projects/firewalk/)
* Firewalk is an active reconnaissance network security tool that attempts to determine what layer 4 protocols a  given IP forwarding device will pass. Firewalk  works  by sending out TCP or UDP packets with a TTL one greater than the targeted gateway.  If the gateway allows the traffic, it will forward the packets to the next hop where they will expire and elicit an ICMP_TIME_EXCEEDED  message.  If the gateway hostdoes not allow the traffic, it will likely drop the packets on  the floor and we will see no response. To get  the  correct  IP  TTL that will result in expired packets one beyond the gateway we need  to  ramp  up  hop-counts.   We  do  this  in the same manner that traceroute works.  Once we have the gateway hopcount (at  that point the scan is said to be `bound`) we can begin our scan.

[Softera LDAP Browser](http://www.ldapbrowser.com/info_softerra-ldap-browser.htm)
* LDAP Browser that supports most LDAP implementations. Non-free software, 30-day free trial

[SPScan]http://sourceforge.net/projects/spscan/)

..* download all pics from a Twitter user
..* hashtags used by the Twitter user and when are used (date and time)
..* user mentions by the the Twitter user and when are occurred (date and time)
..* topics used by the Twitter user


[hping](http://www.hping.org/)
* hping is a command-line oriented TCP/IP packet assembler/analyzer. The interface is inspired to the ping(8) unix command, but hping isn't only able to send ICMP echo requests. It supports TCP, UDP, ICMP and RAW-IP protocols, has a traceroute mode, the ability to send files between a covered channel, and many other features. 

[net-creds](https://github.com/DanMcInerney/net-creds)

* It sniffs: URLs visited; POST loads sent; HTTP form logins/passwords; HTTP basic auth logins/passwords; HTTP searches; FTP logins/passwords; IRC logins/passwords; POP logins/passwords; IMAP logins/passwords; Telnet logins/passwords; SMTP logins/passwords; SNMP community string; NTLMv1/v2 all supported protocols like HTTP, SMB, LDAP, etc; Kerberos.

  [RANCID - Really Awesome New Cisco confIg Differ](http://www.shrubbery.net/rancid/)
* RANCID monitors a router's (or more generally a device's) configuration, including software and hardware (cards, serial numbers, etc) and uses CVS (Concurrent Version System) or Subversion to maintain history of changes.
* RANCID does this by the very simple process summarized as: login to each device in the router table (router.db), run various commands to get the information that will be saved, cook the output; re-format, remove oscillating or incrementing data, email any differences (sample) from the previous collection to a mail list, and finally commit those changes to the revision control system


[Stenographer](https://github.com/google/stenographer/blob/master/README.md)
* Stenographer is a full-packet-capture utility for buffering packets to disk for intrusion detection and incident response purposes. It provides a high-performance implementation of NIC-to-disk packet writing, handles deleting those files as disk fills up, and provides methods for reading back specific sets of packets quickly and easily.




###MitM Tools

* A collection of ZAP scripts provided by the community - pull requests very welcome! 

[Echo Mirage](http://www.wildcroftsecurity.com/echo-mirage)
* Echo Mirage is a generic network proxy. It uses DLL injection and function hooking techniques to redirect network related function calls so that data transmitted and received by local applications can be observed and modified. Windows encryption and OpenSSL functions are also hooked so that plain text of data being sent and received over an encrypted session is also available. Traffic can be intercepted in real-time, or manipulated with regular expressions and a number of action directives


[Burp Proxy](http://portswigger.net/burp/proxy.html)
* Burp Proxy is an intercepting proxy server for security testing of web applications. It operates as a man-in-the-middle between your browser and the target application

[Phreebird](http://dankaminsky.com/phreebird/)

[Enumerating DNSSEC NSEC and NSEC3 Records](https://www.altsci.com/concepts/page.php?s=dnssec&p=1


[Event Tracing for Windows and Network Monitor](http://blogs.technet.com/b/netmon/archive/2009/05/13/event-tracing-for-windows-and-network-monitor.aspx)

* "Event Tracing for Windows, (ETW), has been around for quite a while now as it was introduced in Windows 2000. It's basically instrumented logging that describes what a component is doing. Conceptually, it’s something like the proverbial printf("here1") concept used by programmers, but it is present in retail builds. When you enable logging in a component the result is an ETL (Event Trace Log) file. What’s new is that that Network Monitor can read any ETL file. And with the supplied parsers many network oriented ETW providers can be decoded."



###<a name="ipv6">IPv6 Related</a>
[Exploiting Tomorrow's Internet Today: Penetration testing with IPv6](http://uninformed.org/?v=all&a=46&t=sumry)
* This paper illustrates how IPv6-enabled systems with link-local and auto-configured addresses can be compromised using existing security tools. While most of the techniques described can apply to "real" IPv6 networks, the focus of this paper is to target IPv6-enabled systems on the local network. 

[IPv6 Toolkit](https://github.com/fgont/ipv6toolkit)
* SI6 Networks' IPv6 Toolkit

[THC-IPv6](https://www.thc.org/thc-ipv6/)

###<a name="evasion">IDS/IPS Evasion</a>


[Intrusion detection evasion:  How Attackers get past the burglar alarm](http://www.sans.org/reading-room/whitepapers/detection/intrusion-detection-evasion-attackers-burglar-alarm-1284)
* The purpose of this paper is to show methods that attackers can use to fool IDS systems into thinking their attack is legitimate traffic. With techniques like obfuscation, fragmentation, Denial of Service, and application hijacking the attacker can pass traffic under the nose of an IDS to prevent their detection. These are techniques that the next generation of IDS needs to be able to account for and prevent. Since it would be almost impossible to create a product that was not vulnerable to one of these deceptions.


[Beating the IPS](http://www.sans.org/reading-room/whitepapers/intrusion/beating-ips-34137) 
* This paper introduces various Intrusion Prevention System (IPS) evasion techniques and shows how they can be used to successfully evade detection by widely used products from major security vendors. By manipulating the header, payload, and traffic flow of a well-known attack, it is possible to trick the IPS inspection engines into passing the traffic - allowing the attacker shell access to the target system protected by the IPS.
