[Archassault](https://archassault.org/)
* The ArchAssault Project is an Arch Linux derivative for penetration testers, security professionals and all-around Linux enthusiasts. This means we import the vast majority of the official upstream Arch Linux packages, these packages are unmodified from their upstream source. While our Arch Linux base is primarily untouched, there are times were we have to fork a package to be able to better support our vast selection of tools. All of our packages strive to maintain the Arch Linux standards, methods and philosophies.

[Kali linux](https://www.kali.org/)
* You do pentesting with it.

[Tails](https://tails.boum.org/)
*  Tails is a live operating system, that you can start on almost any computer from a DVD, USB stick, or SD card. It aims at preserving your privacy and anonymity, and helps you to: use the Internet anonymously and circumvent censorship; all connections to the Internet are forced to go through the Tor network; leave no trace on the computer you are using unless you ask it explicitly; use state-of-the-art cryptographic tools to encrypt your files, emails and instant messaging.

[Active Defense Harbinger Distribution (ADHD)](sourceforge.net/projects/adhd/)
* The Active Defense Harbinger Distribution (ADHD) is a Linux distro based on Ubuntu LTS. It comes with many tools aimed at active defense preinstalled and configured. The purpose of this distribution is to aid defenders by giving them tools to "strike back" at the bad guys.  ADHD has tools whose functions range from interfering with the attackers' reconnaissance to compromising the attackers' systems. Innocent bystanders will never notice anything out of the ordinary as the active defense mechanisms are triggered by malicious activity such as network scanning or connecting to restricted services.
