Firstly, if you are reading this hoping to learn how to harden production servers, stop what you’re doing, walk on over to HR, and hand in your notice.

For anyone who *isn’t* trying to harden production servers, please read this:

In, fact, even if you don’t, you should still read it. It lists several common gotchas that plague people new to hardening. 

Having read that, here is Microsoft’s Security Compliance Manager wiki:

Keep in mind that any server hardening should be custom tailored to your operation and environment. You can’t simply take a one-size fits all approach.
