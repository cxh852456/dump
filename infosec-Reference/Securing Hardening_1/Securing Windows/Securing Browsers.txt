Firefox Plugins
One of the beautiful things Firefox are the plugins, and the extra functionality added through them. The list below is my recommendations for securing your browser as well as controlling what information it sends out.
Adblock - Blocks ads. Ads are a large vector of attack due to the lack of verification within the advertising industry.
