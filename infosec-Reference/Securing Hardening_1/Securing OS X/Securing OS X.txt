	OS X Hardening: Securing a Large Mac Fleet
			https://www.usenix.org/conference/lisa13/os-x-hardening-securing-large-global-mac-fleet
	Abstract: 
OS X security is evolving: defenses are improving with each OS release but the days of “Macs don’t get malware” are gone. Recent attacks against the Java Web plugin have kindled a lot of interest in hardening and managing Macs. So how does Google go about defending a large global Mac fleet? Greg will discuss various hardening tweaks and a range of OS X defensive technologies including XProtect, Gatekeeper, Filevault 2, sandboxing, auditd, and mitigations for Java and Flash vulns.
