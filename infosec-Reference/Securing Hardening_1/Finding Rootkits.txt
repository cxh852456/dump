inodeyou
inodeyou is a tool that detects some forms of kernel rootkit file hiding. It detects when certain linux system calls are hooked, replaced by modified versions that shield files from view. It evaluates the disk’s view of the filesystem (via read(2)) and the user’s view of the mounted filesystem (via getdents(2), stat(2), etc.) by comparing the inodes present from both points of view.
