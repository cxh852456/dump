[The Live-Armor Guide Building Custom Live Images with Debian and Grsecurity](https://fatemachine.github.io/live-armor/)
* This guide explains how to build custom live system images for security sandboxing using tools from the Debian Live Systems project and Grsecurity.  For concreteness we will focus on building a custom live image for sandboxing the Firefox web browser (also known as Iceweasel in the Debian world). However, the same tools and procedures will allow you to build any kind of Debian-based live image you want.

[Protecting Data on Smartphones and Tablets from Memory Attacks](http://research.microsoft.com/en-us/um/people/alecw/asplos-2015.pdf)
* Smartphones and tablets are easily lost or stolen. This makes them susceptible to an inexpensive class of memory attacks, such as cold- boot attacks, using a bus monitor to observe the memory bus, and DMA attacks. This paper describes Sentry, a system that allows applications and OS components to store their code and data on the System-on-Chip (SoC) rather than in DRAM. We use ARM- specific mechanisms originally designed for embedded systems, but still present in today’s mobile devices, to protect applications and OS subsystems from memory attacks
