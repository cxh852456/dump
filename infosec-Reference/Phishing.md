[sptoolkit-rebirth](https://github.com/simplephishingtoolkit/sptoolkit-rebirth)
* sptoolkit hasn't been actively developed for two years. As it stands, it's a brilliant peice of software, and the original developers are pretty damn awesome for creating it. But we'd like to go further, and bring sptoolkit up to date. We've tried contacting the developers, but to no avail. We're taking matters into our own hands now.
