[Introduction to Reverse Engineering Software](http://althing.cs.dartmouth.edu/local/www.acm.uiuc.edu/sigmil/RevEng/)
* This book is an attempt to provide an introduction to reverse engineering software under both Linux and Microsoft Windows©. Since reverse engineering is under legal fire, the authors figure the best response is to make the knowledge widespread. The idea is that since discussing specific reverse engineering feats is now illegal in many cases, we should then discuss general approaches, so that it is within every motivated user's ability to obtain information locked inside the black box. Furthermore, interoperability issues with closed-source proprietary systems are just plain annoying, and something needs to be done to educate more open source developers as to how to implement this functionality in their software.

[Bug Hunting for the Man on the Street]()
* Finding and discovering bugs has to be one of the most special times in a security researchers life (until you realise that crash you've been searching for and finally found is not actually exploitable). But the process of searching, discovery, understanding and of course some very much needed trial and error, many would say are rewarding and fulfilling themselves (I would of course, prefer to have my exploit cherry on the top)! So this talk will detail some of the aspects required to hunt down and find these coveted security vulnerabilities and bugs and some approaches that have proven to be invaluable (and some not so much). Of course bug hunting principle need to produce bugs so as the cherry there will be a virtual box exploit and Barracuda networks 0 day exploit discussed and demon

* Kam1n0 is a scalable system that supports assembly code clone search. It allows a user to first index a (large) collection of binaries, and then search for the code clones of a given target function or binary file. Kam1n0 tries to solve the efficient subgraph search problem (i.e. graph isomorphism problem) for assembly functions. Given a target function (the middle one in the figure below) it can identity the cloned subgraphs among other functions in the repository (the ones on the left and the right as shown below). Kam1n0 supports rich comment format and has an IDA Pro plug-in to use its indexing and searching capabilities via IDA Pro.

[TAMPER (Tamper And Monitoring Protection Engineering Research)](http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/research/security/tamper/)
* In the TAMPER Lab, we study existing security products, document how they have been penetrated in the past, develop new attack techniques, and try to forecast how newly available technologies will make it easier to bypass hardware security mechanisms. We then develop and evaluate new countermeasures and assist industrial designers in staying ahead of the game, most of all by giving them an advanced understanding of which attack techniques are most dangerous. We are especially interested in protection systems for mass-market applications, and in forensic applications.

[WinAppDbg](http://winappdbg.sourceforge.net/)
* The WinAppDbg python module allows developers to quickly code instrumentation scripts in Python under a Windows environment.  It uses ctypes to wrap many Win32 API calls related to debugging, and provides a powerful abstraction layer to manipulate threads, libraries and processes, attach your script as a debugger, trace execution, hook API calls, handle events in your debugee and set breakpoints of different kinds (code, hardware and memory). Additionally it has no native code at all, making it easier to maintain or modify than other debuggers on Windows.  The intended audience are QA engineers and software security auditors wishing to test or fuzz Windows applications with quickly coded Python scripts. Several ready to use tools are shipped and can be used for this purposes.  Current features also include disassembling x86/x64 native code, debugging multiple processes simultaneously and produce a detailed log of application crashes, useful for fuzzing and automated testing.

[xnippet](https://github.com/isislab/xnippet)
* xnippet is a tool that lets you load code snippets or isolated functions (no matter the operating system they came from), pass parameters to it in several formats (signed decimal, string, unsigned hexadecimal...), hook other functions called by the snippet and analyze the result. The tool is written in a way that will let me improve it in a future, defining new calling conventions and output argument pointers.

[HyperDbg](https://github.com/rmusser01/hyperdbg/)
* HyperDbg is a kernel debugger that leverages hardware-assisted virtualization. More precisely, HyperDbg is based on a minimalistic hypervisor that is installed while the system runs. Compared to traditional kernel debuggers (e.g., WinDbg, SoftIce, Rasta R0 Debugger) HyperDbg is completely transparent to the kernel and can be used to debug kernel code without the need of serial (or USB) cables. For example, HyperDbg allows to single step the execution of the kernel, even when the kernel is executing exception and interrupt handlers. Compared to traditional virtual machine based debuggers (e.g., the VMware builtin debugger), HyperDbg does not require the kernel to be run as a guest of a virtual machine, although it is as powerful.

[simpliFiRE.AntiRE - An Executable Collection of Anti-Reversing Techniques](https://bitbucket.org/fkie_cd_dare/simplifire.antire)
* AntiRE is a collection of such anti analysis approaches, gathered from various sources like Peter Ferrie's The "Ultimate" Anti-Debugging Reference and Ange Albertini's corkami. While these techniques by themselves are nothing new, we believe that the integration of these tests in a single, executable file provides a comprehensive overview on these, suitable for directly studying their behaviour in a harmless context without additional efforts. AntiRE includes different techniques to detect or circumvent debuggers, fool execution tracing, and disable memory dumping. Furthermore, it can detect the presence of different virtualization environments and gives examples of techniques used to twarth static analysis.

[ALPHA3[(https://code.google.com/p/alpha3/)
* ALPHA3 is a tool for transforming any x86 machine code into 100% alphanumeric code with similar functionality. It works by encoding the original code into alphanumeric data and combining this data with a decoder, which is a piece of x86 machine code written specifically to be 100% alphanumeric. When run, the decoder converts the data back to the original code, after which it is executed.

[Windows Anti-Debugging Reference](http://www.symantec.com/connect/articles/windows-anti-debug-reference)
* This paper classifies and presents several anti-debugging techniques used on Windows NT-based operating systems. Anti-debugging techniques are ways for a program to detect if it runs under control of a debugger. They are used by commercial executable protectors, packers and malicious software, to prevent or slow-down the process of reverse-engineering. We'll suppose the program is analyzed under a ring3 debugger, such as OllyDbg on Windows platforms. The paper is aimed towards reverse-engineers and malware analysts. Note that we will talk purely about generic anti-debugging and anti-tracing techniques. Specific debugger detection, such as window or processes enumeration, registry scanning, etc. will not be addressed here

* When trying to recover/carve deleted data, some reverse engineering of the file format may be required. Without knowing how the data is stored, we cannot recover the data of interest - be it timestamps, messages, images, video or another type of data. This quick blog post is intended to give some basic tips that have been observed during monkey's latest travels into reverse engineering of file formats. It was done partly as a memory aid/thinking exercise but hopefully other monkeys will find it useful. This post assumes there's no obfuscation/encryption applied to the file and it does not cover reverse engineering malware exes (which is another kettle of bananas).  - Great post/write-up

[Event Tracing for Windows and Network Monitor](http://blogs.technet.com/b/netmon/archive/2009/05/13/event-tracing-for-windows-and-network-monitor.aspx)
* "Event Tracing for Windows, (ETW), has been around for quite a while now as it was introduced in Windows 2000. It's basically instrumented logging that describes what a component is doing. Conceptually, it’s something like the proverbial printf("here1") concept used by programmers, but it is present in retail builds. When you enable logging in a component the result is an ETL (Event Trace Log) file. What’s new is that that Network Monitor can read any ETL file. And with the supplied parsers many network oriented ETW providers can be decoded."

[The Art of Unpacking - Paper](https://www.blackhat.com/presentations/bh-usa-07/Yason/Whitepaper/bh-usa-07-yason-WP.pdf)
* Abstract: The main purpose of this paper is to present anti-reversing techniques employed by 
executable packers/protectors and also discusses techniques and publicly available tools that 
can be used to bypass or disable this protections. This information will allow researchers, 
especially, malcode analysts to identify these techniques when utilized by packed malicious 
code, and then be able decide the next move when these anti-reversing techniques impede 
successful analysis. As a secondary purpose, the information presented can also be used by 
researchers that are planning to add some level of protection in their software by slowing 
down reversers from analyzing their protected code, but of course, nothing will stop a skilled, 
informed, and determined reverser

[Inside Blizzard: Battle.net](http://uninformed.org/?v=all&a=8&t=sumry)
* This paper intends to describe a variety of the problems Blizzard Entertainment has encountered from a practical standpoint through their implementation of the large-scale online game matchmaking and chat service, Battle.net. The paper provides some background historical information into the design and purpose of Battle.net and continues on to discuss a variety of flaws that have been observed in the implementation of the system. Readers should come away with a better understanding of problems that can be easily introduced in designing a matchmaking/chat system to operate on such a large scale in addition to some of the serious security-related consequences of not performing proper parameter validation of untrusted clients.

[Memalyze: Dynamic Analysis of Memory Access Behavior in Software](http://uninformed.org/?v=all&a=31&t=sumry)
* This paper describes strategies for dynamically analyzing an application's memory access behavior. These strategies make it possible to detect when a read or write is about to occur at a given location in memory while an application is executing. An application's memory access behavior can provide additional insight into its behavior. For example, it may be able to provide an idea of how data propagates throughout the address space. Three individual strategies which can be used to intercept memory accesses are described in this paper. Each strategy makes use of a unique method of intercepting memory accesses. These methods include the use of Dynamic Binary Instrumentation (DBI), x86 hardware paging features, and x86 segmentation features. A detailed description of the design and implementation of these strategies for 32-bit versions of Windows is given. Potential uses for these analysis techniques are described in detail. 

[An Objective Analysis of the Lockdown Protection System for Battle.net](http://uninformed.org/?v=all&a=40&t=sumry)
* Near the end of 2006, Blizzard deployed the first major update to the version check and client software authentication system used to verify the authenticity of clients connecting to Battle.net using the binary game client protocol. This system had been in use since just after the release of the original Diablo game and the public launch of Battle.net. The new authentication module (Lockdown) introduced a variety of mechanisms designed to raise the bar with respect to spoofing a game client when logging on to Battle.net. In addition, the new authentication module also introduced run-time integrity checks of client binaries in memory. This is meant to provide simple detection of many client modifications (often labeled "hacks") that patch game code in-memory in order to modify game behavior. The Lockdown authentication module also introduced some anti-debugging techniques that are designed to make it more difficult to reverse engineer the module. In addition, several checks that are designed to make it difficult to simply load and run the Blizzard Lockdown module from the context of an unauthorized, non-Blizzard-game process. After all, if an attacker can simply load and run the Lockdown module in his or her own process, it becomes trivially easy to spoof the game client logon process, or to allow a modified game client to log on to Battle.net successfully. However, like any protection mechanism, the new Lockdown module is not without its flaws, some of which are discussed in detail in this paper.

[Improving Automated Analysis of Windows x64 Binaries](http://uninformed.org/?v=all&a=18&t=sumry)
* As Windows x64 becomes a more prominent platform, it will become necessary to develop techniques that improve the binary analysis process. In particular, automated techniques that can be performed prior to doing code or data flow analysis can be useful in getting a better understanding for how a binary operates. To that point, this paper gives a brief explanation of some of the changes that have been made to support Windows x64 binaries. From there, a few basic techniques are illustrated that can be used to improve the process of identifying functions, annotating their stack frames, and describing their exception handler relationships. Source code to an example IDA plugin is also included that shows how these techniques can be implemented.
