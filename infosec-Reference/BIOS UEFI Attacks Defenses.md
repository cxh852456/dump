[Attacks on UEFI security, inspired by Darth Venamis's misery and Speed Racer](https://media.ccc.de/browse/congress/2014/31c3_-_6129_-_en_-_saal_2_-_201412282030_-_attacks_on_uefi_security_inspired_by_darth_venamis_s_misery_and_speed_racer_-_rafal_wojtczuk_-_corey_kallenberg.html#video)
* On modern Intel based computers there exists two powerful and protected code regions: the UEFI firmware and System Management Mode (SMM). UEFI is the replacement for conventional BIOS and has the responsibility of initializing the platform. SMM is a powerful mode of execution on Intel CPUs that is even more privileged than a hypervisor. Because of their powerful positions, SMM and UEFI are protected by a variety of hardware mechanisms. In this talk, Rafal Wojtczuk and Corey Kallenberg team up to disclose several prevalent vulnerabilities that result in SMM runtime breakin as well as arbitrary reflash of the UEFI firmware.

| **BIOS Chronomancy: Fixing the Core Root of Trust for Measurement - BlackHat 2013** | https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NbYZ4UCN9GY
| **Hacking Measured Boot and UEFI - Defcon20** - There's been a lot buzz about UEFI Secure Booting, and the ability of hardware and software manufacturers to lock out third-party loaders (and rootkits). Even the NSA has been advocating the adoption of measured boot and hardware-based integrity checks. But what does this trend mean to the open source and hacker communities? In this talk I'll demonstrate measured boot in action. I'll also be releasing my new Measured Boot Tool which allows you to view Trusted Platform Module (TPM) boot data and identify risks such as unsigned early-boot drivers. And, I'll demonstrate how measured boot is used for remote device authentication.  Finally, I'll discuss weaknesses in the system (hint: bootstrapping trust is still hard), what this technology means to the consumerization trend in IT, and what software and services gaps exist in this space for aspiring entrepreneurs.| https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oiqcog1sk2E

## Firmware Analysis
| Title     | Link |
| -------- | ------------------------ |
| **An Introduction to Firmware Analysis[30c3]** - This talk gives an introduction to firmware analysis: It starts with how to retrieve the binary, e.g. get a plain file from manufacturer, extract it from an executable or memory device, or even sniff it out of an update process or internal CPU memory, which can be really tricky. After that it introduces the necessary tools, gives tips on how to detect the processor architecture, and explains some more advanced analysis techniques, including how to figure out the offsets where the firmware is loaded to, and how to start the investigation. | https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kvfP7StmFxY

| **Attacking UEFI Boot Script** - Abstract—UEFI Boot Script is a data structure interpreted by UEFI firmware during S3 resume. We show that on many systems, an attacker with ring0 privileges can alter this data structure. As a result, by forcing S3 suspend/resume cycle, an attacker can run arbitrary code on a platform that is not yet fully locked. The consequences include ability to overwrite the flash storage and take control over SMM.| https://frab.cccv.de/system/attachments/2566/original/venamis_whitepaper.pdf
