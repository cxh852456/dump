##Simulations

[Shadow](http://shadow.github.io/)
* Summary: Shadow is a unique, open source discrete-event network simulator that runs real applications like Tor. Shadow combines the accuracy of emulation with the efficiency and control of simulation, achieving the best of both approaches 


[Hflow2](https://projects.honeynet.org/hflow)
* Data Analysis System




[VirtualPlant](http://wroot.org/projects/virtuaplant/)
* VirtuaPlant is a Industrial Control Systems simulator which adds a “similar to real-world control logic” to the basic “read/write tags” feature of most PLC simulators. Paired with a game library and 2d physics engine, VirtuaPlant is able to present a GUI simulating the “world view” behind the control system allowing the user to have a vision of the would-be actions behind the control systems.
