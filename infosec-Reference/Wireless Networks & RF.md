| **Security of RFID Protocols – A Case Study** | 
In the context of Dolev-Yao style analysis of security proto cols, we investigate the security claims of a pro- posed strong-security RFID authentication protocol. We ex hibit a flaw which has gone unnoticed in RFID protocol literature and present the resulting attacks on au thentication, untraceability, and desynchroniza- tion resistance. We analyze and discuss the authors’ proofs of security. References to other vulnerable protocols are given.

[GSM: SRSLY?](https://events.ccc.de/congress/2009/Fahrplan/events/3654.en.html)
* The worlds most popular radio system has over 3 billion handsets in 212 countries and not even strong encryption. Perhaps due to cold-war era laws, GSM's security hasn't received the scrutiny it deserves given its popularity. This bothered us enough to take a look; the results were surprising. From the total lack of network to handset authentication, to the "Of course I'll give you my IMSI" message, to the iPhone that really wanted to talk to us. It all came as a surprise – stunning to see what $1500 of USRP can do. Add a weak cipher trivially breakable after a few months of distributed table generation and you get the most widely deployed privacy threat on the planet. Cloning, spoofing, man-in-the-middle, decrypting, sniffing, crashing, DoS'ing, or just plain having fun. If you can work a BitTorrent client and a standard GNU build process then you can do it all, too. Prepare to change the way you look at your cell phone, forever

[Wideband GSM Sniffing [27C3]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZrbatnnRxFc)
* GSM is still the most widely used security technology in the world with a user base of 5 billion and a quickly growing number of critical applications. 26C3's rainbow table attack on GSM's A5/1 encryption convinced many users that GSM calls should be considered unprotected. The network operators, however, have not woken up to the threat yet. Perhaps the new capabilities to be unleashed this year -- like wide-band sniffing and real-time signal processing -- will wake them up. Now that GSM A5/1 encryption can be cracked in seconds, the complexity of wireless phone snooping moved to signal processing. Since GSM hops over a multitude of channels, a large chunk of radio spectrum needs to be analyzed, for example with USRPs, and decoded before storage or decoding. We demonstrate how this high bandwidth task can be achieved with cheap programmable phones.


[29C3 GSM: Cell phone network review](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wwco24EsHs
* Did you notice 262 42 in your mobile phone network search list at the last CCC events? Did you and your friends buy SIM cards at the PoC and help test the network by calling each other, or by calling through the bridge to the DECT network services? Did you ever wonder about the details of this open source test network, set up by a team of volunteers in the middle of the city? We would like to tell you all the details of the cell phone network we operate at 29C3, and show you some fancy graphs based on the network activity! We will describe the process of setting up the test network we operate at 29C3, what legal and technical challenges we have faced, and we will describe the actual installation at the CCH. We will also compare this with the 262 42 test networks that were operated using the same open source software but otherwise very different installations at CCC Camp 2011 and 28C3. We will go on to show various statistics that we collect from the network while it has been running.

[GSM MAP](http://gsmmap.org/#!/about) 
* The GSM Security Map compares the protection capabilities of mobile networks. Networks are rated in their protection capabilities relative to a reference network that implements all protection measures that have been seen “in the wild”. The reference is regularly updated to reflect new protection ideas becoming commercially available. Networks, therefore, have to improve continuously to maintain their score, just as hackers are continuously improving their capabilities.

[iSniff](https://github.com/hubert3/iSniff-GPS) 
* iSniff GPS passively sniffs for SSID probes, ARPs and MDNS (Bonjour) packets broadcast by nearby iPhones, iPads and other wireless devices. The aim is to collect data which can be used to identify each device and determine previous geographical locations, based solely on information each device discloses about previously joined WiFi networks.
* iOS devices transmit ARPs which sometimes contain MAC addresses (BSSIDs) of previously joined WiFi networks, as described in [1]. iSniff GPS captures these ARPs and submits MAC addresses to Apple's WiFi location service (masquerading as an iOS device) to obtain GPS coordinates for a given BSSID. If only SSID probes have been captured for a particular device, iSniff GPS can query network names on wigle.net and visualise possible locations.

[Exploiting 802.11 Wireless Driver Vulnerabilities on Windows](http://uninformed.org/?v=all&a=29&t=sumry)
* This paper describes the process of identifying and exploiting 802.11 wireless device driver vulnerabilities on Windows. This process is described in terms of two steps: pre-exploitation and exploitation. The pre-exploitation step provides a basic introduction to the 802.11 protocol along with a description of the tools and libraries the authors used to create a basic 802.11 protocol fuzzer. The exploitation step describes the common elements of an 802.11 wireless device driver exploit. These elements include things like the underlying payload architecture that is used when executing arbitrary code in kernel-mode on Windows, how this payload architecture has been integrated into the 3.0 version of the Metasploit Framework, and the interface that the Metasploit Framework exposes to make developing 802.11 wireless device driver exploits easy. Finally, three separate real world wireless device driver vulnerabilities are used as case studies to illustrate the application of this process. It is hoped that the description and illustration of this process can be used to show that kernel-mode vulnerabilities can be just as dangerous and just as easy to exploit as user-mode vulnerabilities. In so doing, awareness of the need for more robust kernel-mode exploit prevention technology can be raised. 

[Fingerprinting 802.11 Implementations via Statistical Analysis of the Duration Field](http://uninformed.org/?v=all&a=23&t=sumry)
* The research presented in this paper provides the reader with a set of algorithms and techniques that enable the user to remotely determine what chipset and device driver an 802.11 device is using. The technique outlined is entirely passive, and given the amount of features that are being considered for inclusion into the 802.11 standard, seems quite likely that it will increase in precision as the standard marches forward. The implications of this are far ranging. On one hand, the techniques can be used to implement innovative new features in Wireless Intrusion Detection Systems (WIDS). On the other, they can be used to target link layer device driver attacks with much higher precision.

[ravenhid](https://github.com/emperorcow/ravenhid)
* Hardware and software to run a RFID reader to harvest card information. This is the PCB design and Arduino code that will run a RFID reader, allowing you to gather and harvest cards. Typically, a larger reader, such as those in garages, will be more successful, allowing you to ready over a couple feet instead of inches. The board itself is designed to be modular and support multiple methods to output harvested cards once they are read:
	*	 Text file on a MicroSD card
*	 Print out to LCD
*	 Bluetooth Low Energy Arduino serial connection 
* Each of these options are supported in code, but can be ignored on the PCB. The PCB itself has been designed to use a pluggable module for each of these options, making it easy to ignore, install, or change out which ones you find useful.

[Taming Mr Hayes: Mitigating Signaling Based Attacks on Smartphones](https://www.mulliner.org/collin/academic/publications/mrhayes_mulliner_dsn2012.pdf)
* Malicious injection of cellular signaling traffic from mobile phones is an emerging security issue. The respective attacks can be performed by hijacked smartphones and by malware resident on mobile phones. Until today there are no protection mechanisms in place to prevent signaling based attacks other than implementing expensive additions to the cellular core network. In this work we present a protection system that resides on the mobile phone. Our solution works by partitioning the phone software stack into the application operating system and the communication partition. The application system is a standard fully featured Android sys tem. On the other side, communication to the cellular network is mediated by a flexible monitoring and enforcement system running on the communication partition. We implemented and evaluated our protection system on a real smartphone. Our evaluation shows that it can mitigate all currently know n signaling based attacks and in addition can protect users fr om cellular Trojans.
