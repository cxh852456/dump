## Building a Pentest Lab


### VMs Designed to be Attacked

Now, making your own lab filled with software you’ve configured is great and all, but sometimes you want a bit more of a challenge, you don’t want to know what software is running on the machine, you want to go in blind and hack all the things. For this, I recommend:

[Vulnhub](Vulnhub.com)
* Vulnhub is a website dedicated to cataloging various vulnerable VMs from across the web. It also has a healthy community that creates and submits new VMs on a regular basis. As I write this now, I believe there is around 100 or so different VMs on Vulnhub, so you have a bit of variation.

[The Hacker Games - Hack the VM before it hacks you](http://www.scriptjunkie.us/2012/04/the-hacker-games/)
* I have talked about counterattacks here before, and this system has implemented a number of aggressive anti-hacker measures.  In fact, this VM is downright evil. I am probably legally obligated to tell you that it will try to hack you. So if a calculator or message declaring your pwnedness pops up or shows up on your desktop, you asked for it. But don’t worry, it won’t steal your docs or rm you, it will just demonstrate compromise for the game.  To save precious bandwidth, this has been implemented in a minimal tinycore-based VM, and will require VirtualBox to run.

### Personal rant on how to build one
So, I’m biased. That said, two ways to build a lab, local and online. With todays online services, you don’t have to have a powerful server sitting in your house. You can use amazon’s AWS to host VMs and pay only for time used. For some, this may be preferable for the cost/space. Otherwise, if you’re looking for a local solution, Oracle’s Virtualbox and VMWare’s Workstation/Parallels is where its at.

That being said, skip virtualbox. Get VMware ESXi if you’re cool, and have a spare box laying around, if not, grab VMWare Workstation. It works on linux/win and Parallels for OSX. ESXi is a virtualization platform that runs bare metal. If you have hardware for it, I recommend that. Otherwise, Workstation works wonderfully.

Acquiring a copy of Virtualbox/Workstation is also easy. Virtualbox is free and Workstation has 30 day trials.

So, assuming you now have a virtualization platform, whether through a dedicated machine or simply from your lap/desktop, you probably want some machines on it.

I recommend the following boxes:
Windows Server 2003
Windows XP
Windows Vista
Windows 7
Windows 8
Windows Server 2008
Windows Server 2012 
 for
Centos 6.5
Debian 7
Ubuntu 14.04

That gives you a fair amount of variation in environments as well as allowing you to create specific environments you might see. I list the three most common Distros and all windows going back to XP since, Windows is everywhere.

The Linux distros can be downloaded from their respective sites, and Trials exist for the windows images.
