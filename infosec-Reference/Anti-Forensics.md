|**Hiding Data in Hard-Drive's Service Areas** - In this paper we will demonstrate how spinning hard-drives’ serv ice areas 1 can be used to hide data from the operating-system (or any software using the standard OS’s API or the standard ATA commands to access the hard- drive)|http://recover.co.il/SA-cover/SA-cover.pdf
| **Anti-Forensics and Anti-Anti-Forensics Attacks** - Michael Perkins - Everyone's heard the claim: Security through obscurity is no security at all. Challenging this claim is the entire field of steganography itself - the art of hiding things in plain sight. Most people know you can hide a text file inside a photograph, or embed a photograph inside an MP3. But how does this work under the hood? What's new in the stego field?  This talk will explore how various techniques employed by older steganographic tools work and will discuss a new technique developed by the speaker which embodies both data hiding and data enciphering properties by encoding data inside NTFS volumes. A new tool will be released during this talk that will allow attendees to both encode and decode data with this new scheme. |https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J4x8Hz6_hq0 - Slides: [Slides(link)](http://www.slideshare.net/the_netlocksmith/defcon-20-antiforensics-and-antiantiforensics)
